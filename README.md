## The Intelligent Museum
An artistic-curatorial field of experimentation for deep learning and visitor participation

The [ZKM | Center for Art and Media](https://zkm.de/en) and the [Deutsches Museum Nuremberg](https://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/nuernberg/information/) cooperate with the goal of implementing an AI-supported exhibition. Together with researchers and international artists, new AI-based works of art will be realized during the next four years (2020-2023).  They will be embedded in the AI-supported exhibition in both houses. The Project „The Intelligent Museum“ is funded by the Digital Culture Programme of the [Kulturstiftung des Bundes](https://www.kulturstiftung-des-bundes.de/en) (German Federal Cultural Foundation).

As part of the project, digital curating will be critically examined using various approaches of digital art. Experimenting with new digital aesthetics and forms of expression enables new museum experiences and thus new ways of museum communication and visitor participation. The museum is transformed to a place of experience and critical exchange.
